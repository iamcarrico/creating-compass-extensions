# Creating Compass Extensions

This is part of my series on the Backend of Frontend development, focusing on building extensions within Compass. It is meant to be read along with the (Compass Example Gem)[https://github.com/ChinggizKhan/compass-example] project.

## What does it cover?

It is a intro to how to build compass extensions, and what pieces and parts need to be within them. If you are entirely new to compass and Sass, take a look at my presentation on (power-theming Drupal)[https://github.com/ChinggizKhan/power-theming-drupal], which will apply to many front-end projects.

## Where can I get more information?

* (Sass Docs)[http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html]
* (Sass Provided Functions)[http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/Sass/Script/Functions.html]
* (Team Sass Github page)[https://github.com/Team-Sass/]

## Pretty!
